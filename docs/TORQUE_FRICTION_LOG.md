# Torque MCP Integration — Friction Log

## Integration Overview
Proof of Ship integrates Torque to track builder shipping velocity and backer engagement across the platform. Events are fired on project submissions, milestone completions, project backing, and AI agent usage.

## Setup Experience

### What Worked
- Torque docs are clear on the ingestion API shape (`POST https://ingest.torque.so/events`)
- The `userPubkey` + `eventName` + `timestamp` schema is minimal and easy to map to existing data
- Server-side proxy pattern keeps the API key secure while allowing client-initiated events

### Friction Points

| # | Category | Description | Severity |
|---|----------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | **Documentation** | No explicit REST API docs for ingestion — had to infer from quickstart + MCP examples. Would benefit from a standalone API reference page. | Medium |
| 2 | **Event Schemas** | Custom event schemas require creation via MCP tools or the server REST API (`POST https://server.torque.so/events` with `name` + `fields`). No bulk import or schema-as-code option. Discovered the server API through trial-and-error — not documented. | Medium |
| 3 | **Error Responses** | When sending malformed events, error messages could be more descriptive. Currently returns generic 4xx without field-level validation hints. | Low |
| 4 | **Leaderboard API** | No documented leaderboard retrieval API. We built our own from Firestore data + Torque events. A `GET /leaderboard` endpoint with velocity scores would save significant effort. | High |
| 5 | **Authentication** | Bearer token auth is simple but no mention of token rotation, scoping, or rate limits in docs. Would benefit from API key scopes (read-only, write-only, etc.). | Low |
| 6 | **MCP Tool Discovery** | The MCP server provides event tracking but no built-in analytics or dashboard queries. Adding query tools (top builders, event counts, velocity trends) would make the MCP much more useful. | Medium |

## Architecture Decisions

### Why a Server-Side Proxy?
The `TORQUE_API_KEY` is kept server-side only. Client code calls `/api/torque/events`, which forwards to Torque. This prevents API key exposure in browser bundles.

### Graceful Degradation
All Torque tracking is fire-and-forget. If the API key is missing or the request fails, the core app flow is never blocked. This is critical for a hackathon demo where we might not have credentials configured.

### Event Mapping
| Proof of Ship Action | Torque Event | User Identifier |
|---------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Project submitted | `project_submitted` | Firebase UID / wallet address |
| Project backed | `project_backed` | Wallet address |
| AI agent used | `ai_agent_used` | Wallet address |
| Milestone completed | `milestone_completed` | Firebase UID |

## Metrics We're Tracking
- **Shipping Velocity**: (projects × 5) + (milestones × 10) — weighted to reward completed work over volume
- **Backing Score**: (total staked × 0.1) + (unique projects backed × 10) — rewards diversification
- **AI Engagement**: Tracks which AI agents (underwriter, QVAC analysis) are most used

## Next Steps
- [x] Sign up at platform.torque.so and create project
- [x] Create custom event schemas for all 4 event types
- [ ] Add `TORQUE_API_KEY`, `TORQUE_API_TOKEN`, `TORQUE_PROJECT_ID` to Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Create an active incentive program via Torque MCP to power the BackingPanel banner
- [ ] Build richer leaderboard with time-windowed velocity (7d, 30d, all-time)
- [ ] Attach custom events to project via MCP (required for query builder / incentive targeting)
- [ ] Add real-time leaderboard updates via Torque webhooks (if available)
