# UI/UX Documentation

This document outlines the design system, component library, and visual assets that create a consistent and accessible user experience for the POS Dashboard.

## Phase 1.1: Design Token System

A comprehensive design token system has been established to ensure visual consistency.

- **Color Palette**: 200+ semantic color tokens.
- **Typography Scale**: Font system with Inter and JetBrains Mono.
- **Spacing System**: 4px-based grid system.
- **Shadow System**: Layered shadow tokens.
- **Border Radius**: Consistent radius tokens.
- **Animation System**: Standardized transitions and easing curves.
- **Z-Index Scale**: Organized layering system.

### Theme System

- Light, Dark, and High-Contrast themes are supported.
- System preference detection and local storage persistence.
- Accessible themes (WCAG 2.1 compliant).

## Phase 1.2: Component Library Standardization

A robust and reusable component library has been built on top of the design token system.

### Core Components

- **Buttons**: 8 variants, 4 sizes, loading/disabled states, and icon support.
- **Forms**: Standardized inputs, textareas, selects, checkboxes, and radio buttons with validation states.
- **Cards**: Flexible card system with multiple variants (Base, Stat, Feature, Project).
- **Modals**: Accessible modal/dialog system with portal rendering.
- **Toasts**: Context-based notification system with promise support.

### Key Features

- **Consistent API**: Standardized props across all components.
- **Accessibility First**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and focus management.
- **Theme Aware**: Components automatically adapt to theme changes.
- **Loading States**: Built-in loading states for interactive components.

## Phase 1.3: Icon and Illustration System

A comprehensive system for icons and illustrations enhances the user experience by providing clear visual cues.

### Icon System

- **Flexible Icon Component**: Integrates Heroicons and custom domain-specific icons.
- **Variants**: Multiple sizes and semantic colors.
- **Status & Network Icons**: Contextual and brand-specific icons.

### Illustration System

- **Loading States**: Spinners, pulsing dots, and skeleton loaders for better perceived performance.
- **Empty States**: Actionable empty states for various contexts (e.g., no projects, no data).
- **Error States**: Illustrations for different error types (network, API, 404) with retry actions.

## Phase 2.1: Credit Score Visualization

Engaging and interactive visualizations for the credit scoring system.

### Key Components

- **Animated Circular Progress**: For displaying credit scores with smooth animations.
- **Interactive Score Breakdown**: A multi-segment chart with hover interactions.
- **Score History Visualization**: Line charts (via Chart.js) to show score history with time-range filtering.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: AI-generated, prioritized recommendations to improve credit scores.
- **Credit Tier Badges**: Animated badges and cards to show credit tiers and progress.

## Phase 2.3: MetaMask Integration Polish

This phase is about refining the wallet interaction to make it feel seamless, secure, and professional.

- **Finalize Transaction Confirmation Modal**: Fully integrate the `TransactionConfirmModal` to prevent accidental transactions by forcing users to review and explicitly confirm actions.
- **Implement Success Animations**: Use the `SuccessIllustration` component with a Lottie animation to provide clear, positive feedback after a successful transaction.
- **Refine Network Switching and Balance Display**: Integrate the `NetworkSwitcher.js` and `USDCBalanceDisplay.js` components into the main UI to guide users and provide a clear view of their funds.

## Phase 3: Builder Protocol UI/UX

The evolution into a builder-centric protocol requires several new user flows and interfaces. This section outlines the UI/UX strategy for these new features, leveraging the existing design system and component library.

### 3.1 On-Chain Project Registration

This is the new entry point for builders. The experience must be simple, secure, and transparent.

- **User Flow**:
  1.  A new "Register Project" button will be prominently displayed on the dashboard for authenticated users.
  2.  Clicking this opens a `Modal` component (`src/components/common/Modal.js`).
  3.  The modal will contain a simple form with an `Input` component (`src/components/common/Input.js`) for the project's GitHub URL.
  4.  A `Button` (`src/components/common/Button.js`) will initiate the registration. It will have a `loading` state to provide feedback.
  5.  The user will be prompted to approve two transactions in their wallet: one for the USDC stake (`approve`) and one for the `registerProject` function call.
  6.  `Toast` notifications (`src/components/common/Toast.js`) will provide real-time feedback on the transaction status (e.g., "Awaiting confirmation...", "Project registered successfully!", "Transaction failed.").
- **Key Components to Use**: `Modal`, `Button`, `Input`, `Toast`, `LoadingSpinner`.

### 3.2 Enhanced Builder Dashboard

Once a builder has registered projects, their dashboard view needs to evolve to become their mission control.

- **New "My Projects" Section**: This section will use a list of `ProjectCard` components (`src/components/projects/ProjectCard.js`) to display all projects registered by the user.
- **Loan Status on Project Card**: The `ProjectCard` will be enhanced to include a `LoanStatus` badge, showing if a loan is "Active," "Repaid," or "Rolled Over."
- **Milestone Tracking**: Within a project's detail view, a new `MilestoneTracker` component will visualize the required milestones for their active loan, showing which ones have been verified by the oracle. This could be a checklist-style interface.
- **Key Components to Use**: `ProjectCard`, `Card`, `Icon`, custom `MilestoneTracker` component.

### 3.3 Hackathon Partner Dashboard

To facilitate the innovative repayment model, hackathon partners need a simple interface to manage their contributions.

- **New `/partner` Route**: A new, access-controlled page for registered partners.
- **Funding Pool UI**: This view will feature a `StatCard` (`src/components/common/cards/StatCard.js`) showing the total value of the partner funding pool. It will also have an input field and button for partners to deposit more USDC.
- **Underwritten Loans List**: A table view listing all the loans currently being underwritten by the partner pool, showing the developer, project, amount, and loan status.
- **Key Components to Use**: `StatCard`, `Input`, `Button`, `Table` (a new common component may be needed).

### 3.4 Multi-Chain Experience

The UI must elegantly handle the multi-chain nature of the protocol.

- **Network Switcher**: The existing `NetworkSwitcher` component (`src/components/wallet/NetworkSwitcher.js`) will be integrated into the main navigation bar, allowing users to switch their wallet's network context easily.
- **Chain-Specific Icons**: When displaying on-chain activity or assets, `NetworkIcon` components (`src/components/common/Icon.js`) will be used to clearly label which chain the activity occurred on.
- **Aggregated Balances**: The UI will display a user's total credit-eligible assets, but provide a breakdown by chain on hover or in a detailed view.
- **Key Components to Use**: `NetworkSwitcher`, `Icon`, `Tooltip` (a new common component may be needed).

## Phase 5: Data Visualization Enhancements

This phase is about transforming static data into rich, interactive, and insightful visualizations.

### 5.1 Project Analytics Improvements

- **Integrate Interactive Charts**: Use Chart.js to replace basic stat displays with interactive charts.
- **Add Time Range Filters**: Allow users to filter analytics data by timeframes.

### 5.2 Contract & Social Protocol UI

- **Implement Third-party Service UI**: Build UI to display contract-level data (e.g., from Thirdweb Nebula).
- **Design Farcaster/Lens Widgets**: Create components that display a user's activity feed, reputation metrics, or social graph.
- **Build Identity Verification Flow**: Design a clear UI for users to verify and link their various social and on-chain identities.

## Phase 6: Performance & Accessibility

This phase ensures the application is fast, reliable, and usable by everyone.

### 6.1 Performance Optimization

- **Implement Lazy Loading**: For heavy components or images.
- **Add Skeleton Screens**: Refine and expand the use of skeleton components.
- **Implement Virtual Scrolling**: For potentially long lists.

### 6.2 Accessibility Improvements (A11y)

- **Audit Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure every interactive element is keyboard-accessible.
- **Add ARIA Labels**: Add appropriate `aria-label` attributes to non-descriptive elements.
- **Check Color Contrast**: Verify that all text has sufficient contrast against its background.

## Phase 7: Advanced Features

This final phase focuses on adding "delightful" and powerful features that differentiate the application.

### 7.1 Real-time Updates & Gamification

- **Implement WebSockets**: Push live data to the client for real-time updates.
- **Design an Achievement System**: Create badges or trophies for reaching milestones.
- **Build Leaderboards**: Create public leaderboards to foster friendly competition.
