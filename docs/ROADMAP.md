# Roadmap

- Builder Credit System

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Builder Credit System**: An AI-powered platform that provides instant liquidity to hackathon developers based on their creditworthiness, determined by GitHub activity, on-chain behavior, and social reputation across Farcaster and Lens protocols.

### Core Concept

- **Developers** showcase progress on our dashboard
- **AI agents** track and score their creditworthiness
- **Smart contracts** provide conditional funding
- **Hackathon sponsors** back successful loans for builders who meet milestones
- **Social protocols** bootstrap initial reputation scores

## 🏆 Metamask Hackathon Track Alignment

### **Primary Track: Smart Agents & Liquidity Automation ($6k)**

- AI agents for automated creditworthiness assessment
- Real-time liquidity management for builder funding pools
- Smart contract automation for conditional payments
- Cross-chain portfolio rebalancing for funding distribution

### **Secondary Track: Identity & OnChain Reputation ($6k)**

- Multi-protocol reputation scoring (GitHub + Farcaster + Lens + On-chain)
- Behavioral credit assessment based on development patterns
- Tiered access system based on reputation levels
- Privacy-preserving reputation aggregation

### **Bonus Opportunities ($6k total)**

- **MetaMask SDK integration** ($2k) - Wallet connection and card integration

        bytes32[] requiredMilestones;
        mapping(bytes32 => bool) completedMilestones;
    }

    function requestFunding(
        bytes32 githubCommitHash,
        string memory farcasterHandle,
        string memory lensProfile,
        address[] memory deployedContracts
    ) external;

    function updateReputation(
        address developer,
        uint256 newGithubScore,
        uint256 newSocialScore,
        uint256 newOnchainScore
    ) external onlyOracle;

    function verifyMilestone(
