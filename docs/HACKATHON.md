# MetaMask Card Hackathon - Builder Credit System

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Builder Credit System**: An AI-powered platform that provides instant liquidity to hackathon developers based on their creditworthiness, determined by GitHub activity, on-chain behavior, and social reputation across Farcaster and Lens protocols.

### Core Concept

- **Developers** showcase progress on our dashboard
- **AI agents** track and score their creditworthiness
- **Smart contracts** provide conditional funding
- **Hackathon sponsors** back successful loans for builders who meet milestones
- **Social protocols** bootstrap initial reputation scores

## 🏆 Hackathon Track Alignment

### **Primary Track: Smart Agents & Liquidity Automation ($6k)**

- AI agents for automated creditworthiness assessment
- Real-time liquidity management for builder funding pools
- Smart contract automation for conditional payments
- Cross-chain portfolio rebalancing for funding distribution

### **Secondary Track: Identity & OnChain Reputation ($6k)**

- Multi-protocol reputation scoring (GitHub + Farcaster + Lens + On-chain)
- Behavioral credit assessment based on development patterns
- Tiered access system based on reputation levels
- Privacy-preserving reputation aggregation

### **Bonus Opportunities ($6k total)**

- **MetaMask SDK integration** ($2k) - Wallet connection and card integration
- **Circle Wallets** ($2k) - USDC treasury management for funding pools
- **LI.FI SDK** ($2k) - Cross-chain funding distribution

**Total Potential Prize**: $18,000

## 💳 MetaMask Card Integration Details

### Setup

- Configure `.env.local` with Circle and MetaMask API keys.
- Set up Circle and MetaMask developer accounts.

### How It Works

- Funding tiers from $500 to $5,000 USDC based on credit score.
- Credit score is a mix of GitHub (40%), Social (30%), On-chain (20%), and Identity (10%).

### User Flow

1. Connect MetaMask wallet.
2. System analyzes credit data.
3. Funding eligibility is displayed.
4. User requests funding.
5. Automated USDC transfer.
6. Funding history is tracked.
