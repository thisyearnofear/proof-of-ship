# UI/UX Documentation

This document outlines the design system, component library, and visual assets that create a consistent and accessible user experience for the POS Dashboard.

## Phase 1.1: Design Token System

A comprehensive design token system has been established to ensure visual consistency.

- **Color Palette**: 200+ semantic color tokens.
- **Typography Scale**: Font system with Inter and JetBrains Mono.
- **Spacing System**: 4px-based grid system.
- **Shadow System**: Layered shadow tokens.
- **Border Radius**: Consistent radius tokens.
- **Animation System**: Standardized transitions and easing curves.
- **Z-Index Scale**: Organized layering system.

### Theme System

- Light, Dark, and High-Contrast themes are supported.
- System preference detection and local storage persistence.
- Accessible themes (WCAG 2.1 compliant).

## Phase 1.2: Component Library Standardization

A robust and reusable component library has been built on top of the design token system.

### Core Components

- **Buttons**: 8 variants, 4 sizes, loading/disabled states, and icon support.
- **Forms**: Standardized inputs, textareas, selects, checkboxes, and radio buttons with validation states.
- **Cards**: Flexible card system with multiple variants (Base, Stat, Feature, Project).
- **Modals**: Accessible modal/dialog system with portal rendering.
- **Toasts**: Context-based notification system with promise support.

### Key Features

- **Consistent API**: Standardized props across all components.
- **Accessibility First**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and focus management.
- **Theme Aware**: Components automatically adapt to theme changes.
- **Loading States**: Built-in loading states for interactive components.

## Phase 1.3: Icon and Illustration System

A comprehensive system for icons and illustrations enhances the user experience by providing clear visual cues.

### Icon System

- **Flexible Icon Component**: Integrates Heroicons and custom domain-specific icons.
- **Variants**: Multiple sizes and semantic colors.
- **Status & Network Icons**: Contextual and brand-specific icons.

### Illustration System

- **Loading States**: Spinners, pulsing dots, and skeleton loaders for better perceived performance.
- **Empty States**: Actionable empty states for various contexts (e.g., no projects, no data).
- **Error States**: Illustrations for different error types (network, API, 404) with retry actions.

## Phase 2.1: Credit Score Visualization

Engaging and interactive visualizations for the credit scoring system.

### Key Components

- **Animated Circular Progress**: For displaying credit scores with smooth animations.
- **Interactive Score Breakdown**: A multi-segment chart with hover interactions.
- **Score History Visualization**: Line charts (via Chart.js) to show score history with time-range filtering.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: AI-generated, prioritized recommendations to improve credit scores.
- **Credit Tier Badges**: Animated badges and cards to show credit tiers and progress.
